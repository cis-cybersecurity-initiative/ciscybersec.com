								# THE TREASURE WHICH IS PRIVACY <br>
								=============================<br>
								<br>
								Abstract:<br>
								<br>
								The Philosophy of Privacy Extremism emphasizes that privacy should be <br>
								maintained in all situations; that if in question, privacy should be given <br>
								preference, unless sufficient arguments to the contrary apply to the specific situation. <br>
								Privacy serves as a necessary condition for engaging in meaningful and <br>
								truthful interpersonal relationships. <br>
									<br>
								Furthermore privacy is a necessary condition under which a person can develop <br>
								a self and embrace individual responsibility for decisions and actions that <br>
								result from them. <br>
									<br>
								A denial of privacy to the contrary establishes and maintains a lack and loss <br>
								of esteem, respect and value in and for things and other persons. <br>
								<br>
								Privacy should therefor be the strong standard for personal behavior, <br>
								normative for those that thrive towards personal human positive development. <br>
								<br>
								<br>
								The Treasure which is Privacy <br>
								----------------------------- <br>
								The first response to someone who makes an effort to protect his privacy is <br>
								often "I have nothing to hide because I have nothing to fear" - usually <br>
								accompanied by an expression of righteous pride or the blissful presentation <br>
								of carelessness. <br>
								<br>
								As with most routine responses that have become maxims of contemporary society <br>
								and proverbs uttered in reply to trigger words, this statement is more <br>
								informative about the speaker than of the addressee or the subject of <br>
								discussion. <br>
								<br>
								More often than not its underlying meaning should be rephrased to read "I am <br>
								uneasy, maybe even afraid, around people that hide something". As such it <br>
								carries the implied request to anyone hearing it, that they shall stop <br>
								covering and hiding things to relieve the speaker of his uneasiness. <br>
								<br>
								But even when taken at face value, above sentence communicates that it is the <br>
								lack of fear that is the speakers justification for not protecting his <br>
								privacy. Apart from the simple rejection of this statement as being false in <br>
								the light of existing and relevant threats and the reference to the <br>
								blissfulness of ignorance, it is the exclusiveness of fear as the proposed <br>
								reason for privacy that warrants consideration. <br>
								<br>
								<br>
								The reference to fear in this context should first be understood as an <br>
								instrument of rhetorics instead of an adequate choice of words in a balanced <br>
								and clearheaded reasoning. <br>
								Fear refers to the emotional response to existential danger and implies the <br>
								lack or loss of courage to confront the danger. <br>
								The sentence under analysis should thus be rephrased to read "You hide things <br>
								because you lack courage in the presence of an imagined existential threat." <br>
								It is therefor a double accusation of both cowardice and delusion. <br>
								<br>
								Again it is not the focus of this analysis to show that protection of privacy <br>
								and admitting to doing so requires a bit more courage than to repeat common <br>
								proverbs, or that certain dangers exist that can be effectively answered by <br>
								privacy. Nor does it need emphasis that those who protect the privacy of <br>
								others often do so in the face of opponents that go a long way to ruin the <br>
								names, property, freedom and sometimes even health and life of those <br>
								courageous guards of privacy. <br>
 								<br>
								Instead it should be pointed out, that there are for more reasons to protect <br>
								ones privacy, and that of others, than fear of losing freedom or life or even <br>
								good reputation. <br>
								<br>
								It is interesting to note that an old synonym for 'fear' could e awe, <br>
								admiration or astonishment, even respect. <br>
								Worded this way, one might read above sentence as "I hide nothing, because I <br>
								admire and respect nothing." This way it becomes clear that the denial of <br>
								privacy is often nothing but a lack of things that are valued and the demand <br>
								that others should not value something themselves. <br>
								It thus contains the claim that nothing should be special and set apart. <br>
								<br>
								Which brings us to the original meaning of the word 'private'. In Latin it <br>
								refers to persons and things that were set apart from what would be available, <br>
								subordinate and used by all persons - the public. <br>
								<br>
								Thus giving up one's privacy, as in the sentence we discuss, entails nothing <br>
								else but the transformation of the speaker into a not particularly important <br>
								and indistinguishable fragment of the mass. If the speaker is really not in <br>
								fear about anything, it would primarily refer to not fearing to become a <br>
								nothingness in the grey mass - just a grain of dust in the crowd. <br>
								It is safe to say then, that the speaker does not value and respect himself as <br>
								an individual human person, or that he cowardly fears to be recognized as <br>
								such. <br>
								<br>
								Leaving the analysis of the original statement one should now focus on the <br>
								negation of the privacy opponent's reply while keeping its completed meaning <br>
								in mind: <br>
								"Because I value and respect some things, I hide some things." <br>
								<br>
								Three areas shall serve as examples of preserving value through hiding: <br>
								Complex minority opinions, relationships between persons, and the human person <br>
								itself. <br>
									<br>
								Complex opinions and bodies of knowledge that are valued highly by their <br>
								bearers are often only communicated under strict conditions to prevent <br>
								misunderstanding, misrepresentation, confusion and disintegration. <br>
								This is especially useful if the opinion is only held by a minority or if the <br>
								potential audience lacks the necessary context of knowledge to integrate and <br>
								consider the new information. <br>
								The strict conditions under which the information will be communicated serves <br>
								herein as the boundary between public and private. The more complex, valuable <br>
								and different from general knowledge the new information is, the stricter the <br>
								conditions of communicating them becomes. This can be seen in various areas. <br>
								Personal political or moral opinions, especially if they are held only by a  <br>
								minority, will often not be communicated in situations that only allow <br>
								superficial or time restrained conversation. <br>
								These situations do not allow for the speaker to present and argue for their <br>
								position and thus risk for the information to be misunderstood and <br>
								misrepresented later. <br>
								The consequences of this disintegration of information can be witnessed in the <br>
								effects of hearsay that considers itself with minority groups and opinions, <br>
								leading to widespread false myths that often cannot be corrected afterwards <br>
								because they have become part of common knowledge. <br>
								Thus it is often favorable to conceal personal opinion and deprive the public <br>
								of correct information if otherwise the reinforcement of false information or <br>
								the support of slander are likely. <br>
								The quality of public and political debate as well as the celebrity and gossip <br>
								culture serve as evidence for this. <br>
								Numerous further examples about the protection of ideas through hiding exist <br>
								in history and shall only be mentioned for further reference: Pythagorism and <br>
								Platonism, the Apologists of early Christianity, the Orthodox Church liturgy, <br>
								natural science and political societies of the Enlightenment including Bacon <br>
								and Newton as members, Judaism, early Socialism. <br>
								Privacy in this regard serves to preserve the integrity, and often survival, <br>
								of information, ideas and opinions. <br>
								<br>
								Another area of interest is privacy and the use of hiding for the sake of <br>
								other persons. To understand what role privacy plays in the context of <br>
								relationships between humans it is necessary to be aware of what communication <br>
								is. <br>
								Communication is any act of a sender to convey information to a receiver. This <br>
								involves forming signs - distinguishable and perceivable features - into <br>
								signals - the message to be transmitted.<br>
								The choice of signs and signals by the sender and their interpretation by the <br>
								receiver depend strongly on the context, what both parties perceive about each <br>
								other, themselves and their environment. <br>
								Another part of this context is the estimation of how difficult a sign is to <br>
								be produced which has an influence on as how truthful and intentional a signal <br>
								(message) is perceived. <br>
								A proverbial example for this is "to preach water and drink wine". One <br>
								immediately understands that abstaining form wine - which is more costly than <br>
								to consume it - increases the credibility of the message (and resolves the <br>
								otherwise apparent contradiction). <br>
								Maintaining privacy, in its various forms of hiding, concealing and silence, <br>
								is such an act of communication, a sign that carries a signal. <br>
								The sign of privacy, as it shall be called for sake of clarity, can carry a <br>
								variety of signals that depend on the context of the communication, and it can <br>
								be intended for a variety of recipients. <br>
								<br>
								In itself privacy is a signal that discriminates between various degrees of <br>
								relationships, excluding some potential receivers from other intended <br>
								receivers. It is thus communicating which kinds of relationship the sender <br>
								intends to have, which in turn communicates the evaluation of the receiver by <br>
								the sender. <br>
								In blunt words, it separates the receivers into special and common people in <br>
								the eyes of the sender. <br>
								<br>
								The "hijab" is an example which illustrates this well. Hijab refers to a veil <br>
								worn by many muslim women as soon as they enter marriageable age. It is always <br>
								worn in public and only taken off if no non-related men are present, such as <br>
								in exclusively female meetings or in the family circle. Her husband will be <br>
								the only non-related man that will see her hair, thus keeping her hair <br>
								private. <br>
								The woman, if she chooses to wear the hijab, hereby communicates towards her <br>
								husband and all other men, that she chooses to have an exclusive intimate <br>
								relationship only with her husband and that she values her husband as being of <br>
								a special high value to her. It is a pledge of allegiance to her husband, and <br>
								a separation of herself from the availability to other men. <br>
								As can be seen in this example, hiding becomes a tool to communicate a value <br>
								perception and status of relationship in a discriminatory way. <br>
								<br>
								Similar signs exist in western cultures as well. For example, the revelation <br>
								of the family's secret receipt towards the fiancee of a child serves as sign <br>
								of acceptance and inclusion into the family. <br>
								Similarly some topics of conversation are usually preserved for the close <br>
								relationship between couples, or that of good friends. This not only is a sign <br>
								of uptightness, if at all, but also a toll to show and maintain the deepness <br>
								of a special and exclusive relationship that is built on the mutual holding of <br>
								the other in high esteem. <br>
								The opposite, divulging information indiscriminately, thus communicates that <br>
								others are not held in high esteem and that the communicating party is <br>
								unwilling or unable to come to different evaluations of others. <br>
								Likewise the sharing of information with the public, if this information was <br>
								gained within a special relationship, should rightly be viewed as an act of <br>
								betrayal since it communicates that the thus damaged person is held in lower <br>
								regard than the receiving masses, even as assured of the opposite. <br>
								<br>
								This hints at the reciprocity of these intimate relationships. Communicating <br>
								information, that is viewed as belonging in the private domain of friendship <br>
								or other kinds of deep and special relationship, will also signal to the <br>
								receiver that he should answer in an equally private manner as to return the <br>
								esteem granted to him as well as to save the speaker from embarrassment. It is <br>
								thus a matter of courtesy to not speak about private matters indiscriminately <br>
								since it puts the receiver into a potentially awkward situation. <br>
								However, this does not only apply to situations that imply reciprocity. <br>
								It speaks of equal disrespect of another person to make them part of an <br>
								unasked for communication of subjects that are hurtful, unpleasant or put the <br>
								recipient into a situation where he is challenged to act - if only to escape <br>
								his status of a recipient. <br>
								Instead, a communication that considers the reaction of others by using means <br>
								of privacy signals both intended and accidental recipients that the speaker <br>
								harbors respect for them. <br>
								This is even more true when the subject constitutes a tempting or harmful one <br>
								for the recipient. It shows utter disrespect if someone speaks of the <br>
								exquisite taste and warm feeling in the throat when drinking an alcoholic <br>
								beverage while a known dry alcoholic is addressed or present. It is as unwise <br>
								to flaunt with riches and have them lay around openly in the house since this <br>
								tempts the struggling housekeeper to steal out of impulse, or to communicate <br>
								without regard for potentially causing conflicts of interests in the <br>
								recipients. <br>
								Instead of hiding nothing, it is the hiding of information and actions that is <br>
								grounded in valuing and caring for others and truthfully communicating respect <br>
								and high esteem. <br>
								<br>
								To conclude the use of privacy for the sake of others, one should also <br>
								consider the effects of actions on observers. As mentioned before, the <br>
								interpretation of signs as signals depends, among other things, on the <br>
								receiver's perception of the sender. This becomes relevant for the question of <br>
								privacy especially if the sender is perceived as a role model or bad example. <br>
								Here the behavior is a sign easily interpreted by the observer as sanctioning <br>
								of the action or its proscription if the action is not considered separately <br>
								from the sender. <br>
								Examples of this can be seen when bad actions of public figures are used as <br>
								justification for one's own actions, when otherwise laudable behavior is <br>
								viewed with suspicion when associated with persons of disgrace or when people <br>
								imitate celebrities even in their failures and bad judgement. <br>
								For additional consideration on privacy for the sake of others, an old book <br>
								shall be mentioned as reference: "Ueber den Umgang mit Menschen" by Freiherr <br>
								von Knigge.<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								The last area to examine here as an example of preserving value through hiding <br>
								is the human person itself. <br>
								At the core of this matter lies the question of what makes a person a "self" <br>
								instead of "an-other", and how this self can refer to itself over time as in <br>
								"I myself went to the park yesterday". What is this "I" or "self" we refer to, <br>
								and how does it come to be what it is instead of being something else. <br>
								There is no current consensus how to answer these questions, nor should it be <br>
								the task of this text to present and weigh the different views, nor to fully <br>
								develop a theory of personhood on its own. <br>
								<br>
								Instead it will touch the process of the change of a person. How has a person <br>
								become what it is now, and how will it become what it will be in the future? <br>
								How does the process differentiate the self from another? <br>
								<br>
								The popular answer is that genes, upbringing and society are the shapers of <br>
								persons, in different proportions depending on who one asks. Nevertheless <br>
								individuals are treated as moral agents, acting by decision and responsible <br>
								for the decisions made. It is a person who is punished for a crime, and not <br>
								schools, parents, evolution or society.<br>
								It is persons that are persuaded by others, asked to consider moral and<br>
								ethical categories, respected or disgraced for individual actions.<br>
								Clearly it is understood by most that a person is not shaped exclusively by<br>
								that which is not part of him, but also by himself.<br>
								Certainly genes, upbringing, society and the situative environment are<br>
								influences, but it is also the self that forms the self.<br>
								This self-forming takes place with every decision made, changing the status,<br>
								the shape of oneself, the individual path of the person through life.<br>
								<br>
								Some might argue that every decision made is already and exclusively<br>
								determined by the previous state of the person and its environment, and that<br>
								as such no real decision is made because there is no choice but only the<br>
								effect of the cause which is the state of the universe.<br>

								Instead of refuting the deterministic and probabilistic denials of free will<br>
								as being ultimately self-contradictory, it shall be asserted that free will -<br>
								non-deterministic and non-probabilistic - is a required fact if rationality,<br>
								ethics and morality - all three - are in any way justifiable.<br>
								However small free will, that hard to grasp grain that tips the scales of our<br>
								decisions, might be, it plays the central role in the person becoming a Self.<br>
								<br>
								For this to be effectually true, the influence of free will in the person's<br>
								decisions must be maximized so that it is will that dominates the decision in<br>
								freedom.<br>
								At that point privacy achieves its ultimate importance. Only in privacy can a<br>
								decision be contemplated in separation from the influence of other persons and<br>
								the own person, the self, actualized freely.<br>
								Hiding in privacy removes the tainting of the decision through outside<br>
								preselection of facts, outside censorship, the promise of reward and<br>
								punishment by other humans, hubris, pride and shame. Here honesty towards<br>
								one's self is possible.<br>
								It is only through and in privacy where a potential equilibrium of choices can<br>
								be discovered, just to be resolved through the action of the free will of the<br>
								Self.<br>
								<br>
								If one is in any way determined to work on one's own self and aware of the<br>
								responsibility this entails, then privacy in this regard must be maintained.<br>
								Though even through giving up to develop one's self, a choice has been made<br>
								with the responsibility for it as it's consequence - except that this choice<br>
								is to be a product determined by others instead of a self.<br>
								A disregard for maintaining privacy in this area thus equals the utter <br>
								disrespect for the Self one is, and the potential selves one could become. It <br>
								is the denial and defiling of oneself as an individual person. <br>
								<br>
								In conclusion the proposition is, that:<br>
								Only in privacy the "self of now" transcends itself to actualize "the self of<br>
								the future" through every decision made, integrating the "self of the past"<br>
								fully and becoming more of a Self by removing the influence of an Other.<br>
								<br>
								---<br>
								<br>
								In passing by it should be noted that the practice of hiding things because of<br>
								their value, especially if it the hiding of information about something, must<br>
								be subject of consideration as well.<br>
								It cannot be argued for using lies as the method of concealment, since this<br>
								would often result in doing a disfavor to the thing valued and respected. Nor<br>
								can a life of lies result in a positive development of the Self.<br>
								Instead it is the concealing of information, without replacing them with a<br>
								false statement that is communicated as the whole truth only, that should be<br>
								chosen as a means.<br>
								Which however presents another problem:<br>
								As much as the presence of a sign can be a signal, its absence can be one too.<br>
								Indeed it is the presence of some signs that can signal the meaning<br>
								communicated by other signs.<br>
								Selective privacy might as such communicate the content of what should have<br>
								been concealed.<br>
								For example, if one is asked for one's favorite color and presented with a<br>
								series of potential answers, it is the denying of the incorrect answers and<br>
								the silence towards the correct answer that communicates what was intended to<br>
								remain hidden.<br>
								It should thus be noticed, that the hiding of one thing necessitates the<br>
								hiding of other things of the same context. As a means thereof it is<br>
								preferable to keep silent instead of lying, as stated above.<br>
								<br>
								---<br>
								<br>
								So far, the privacy opponent's reply "I have nothing to hide because I have<br>
								nothing to fear" has been shown to be a rhetoric trap, or at least an<br>
								insufficiently contemplated cultural maxim. It has also been shown that there<br>
								exist good reasons to embrace privacy, hiding and concealment.<br>
								However, this text cannot be complete without some short answers to those,<br>
								that identify privacy and secrecy as roots of evil in society that erode every<br>
								social and political system and relationship.<br>
								<br>
								Their primary argument is, that privacy encourages and facilitates all kinds<br>
								of corruption and abuse of power.<br>
								Furthermore they claim that privacy results in the disintegration of the<br>
								interpersonal bonds that hold society together.<br>
								<br>
								To the first, two replies shall be given:<br>
								For one, it has long be understood that abuse of power and corruption are<br>
								systemic to power and delegation themselves, and that transparency and<br>
								accountability are mere interventions to limit the spread of these flaws at<br>
								the root of the problem.<br>
								Instead of attacking privacy as being the problem, one should think about<br>
								alternative methods of cooperation and organization that are free of these<br>
								negative systemic tendencies in themselves.<br>
								On a more shallow note it should be pointed out that the people active in<br>
								positions and offices have given up their status of private persons in<br>
								exchange to be leaders and representatives of the public - the masses.<br>
								Instead of developing themselves and their relationships they have chosen to<br>
								become instruments of the public, or at least they pretend as much.<br>
								How can such an argument against privacy then be used against the privacy of<br>
								people that remain private instead of public? This appears to be fallacious.<br>
								<br>
								Towards their second argument, the "disintegration of interpersonal bonds that<br>
								hold society together", it should be be understood both what "society" is, and<br>
								what "interpersonal bonds" may refer to.<br>
								Society is not a collective of interdependent persons connected b shared<br>
								emotional states and intimacy, that would be what is commonly referred to as<br>
								"family".<br>
								Instead, society is the cooperative organization of persons that is held<br>
								together by norms of interaction and shared understanding of necessary and<br>
								useful methods of cooperation.<br>
								It is thus the actions toward society in the realm of society and not the<br>
								totality of actions and knowledge that constitute these bonds in practice.<br>
								The partaking in society is thus a voluntary, freely chosen and limited<br>
								activity by each of its members for the purpose of cooperation with all other<br>
								others in society.<br>
								Privacy only becomes erosive to societies that intend to regulate and organize<br>
								even those individual activities that neither rely nor influence all of<br>
								society. These societies are commonly identified with Totalitarism.<br>
								Instead of relying on a bonding through a shared experience off weakness and<br>
								lack of self, or directing society to be bound by the smallest - and lowest -<br>
								common denominators, a society of privacy allows for the progression of all<br>
								members to actualize higher potentials without replacing the individual person<br>
								with the collective Other of society.<br>
								Privacy thus nurtures societies that thrive for improvement.<br>
								This might even hold the potential for individual actors to integrate<br>
								justifiable norms of social interaction into their Selves through independent<br>
								contemplation and decisions instead of understanding these norms as being<br>
								imposed by an Other.<br>
								Does this hold the promise of social interaction to become more reliable and<br>
								truthful? Answering affirmative seems to be more justifiable than the<br>
								negation.<br>
								<br>
								However, one warning against privacy is appropriate.<br>
								Be it a personal lifestyle or a culture of privacy, both demand personal<br>
								improvement from each partaking individual.<br>
								This is the result of privacy to allow for, and supporting of, discriminatory<br>
								relationships and the decoupling from the influence of others.<br>
								Privacy thus removes many opportunities to blame others and to excuse oneself<br>
								in light of personal error. Nevertheless, privacy also allows for many<br>
								justified second chances and true forgiveness.<br>
								<br>
								In summary it can be concluded that maintaining privacy and hiding of things<br>
								serves well in preserving and expressing the values one attributes to things<br>
								and other persons.<br>
								Furthermore privacy is a necessary condition for the continual development of<br>
								the Self and the sustentation of truthful and honest interpersonal<br>
								relationships by means of communicative discrimination.<br>
								In turn, the denial of privacy must be realized to be unjustified and even<br>
								harmful. The presented arguments for the allegedly negative impact of privacy<br>
								have been found to be without merit or even supporting the strong use of<br>
								privacy in society.<br>
								<br>
								The conclusion drawn is therefor that opposition to privacy as in "I hide<br>
								nothing because I have nothing to fear" cannot be a default behavior.<br>
								Instead the use and support of privacy in the form of "Because I value many<br>
								things, therefor I hide many things" should be the standard unless it clearly<br>
								needs to be abandoned for specific situations, if at all.<br>
